								<h1>About Firera - Q&A</h1>
								<ul class="qa">
									<li>
										<div>
											Is this for frontend only?
										</div>
										<div>
											Mostly. Although Firera's core is just a Functional Rective Programming(FRP) engine that can be used both on backend and frontend, 
											Firera is targeted firstly for managing the UI in browser. That's why an Ozenfant template engine is included in Firera's dist.
											Also it's handy for communicating with backend etc.
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											So I can write the whole frontend on Firera?
										</div>
										<div>
											Yes! While a lot of FRP libraries are focused on specific sides of frontend apps, Firera beleives you can write the whole 
											application as a set of data streams.
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											Is this a library? A framework?..
										</div>
										<div>
											It looks like a general purpose JS library. A framework might be written some day on the Firera's base. Also it has a features of a...
											new high-level language, compiled into JavaScript.
										</div>
									</li>
									<!--<li>
										<div>
											Can I use Firera along with other frontend libraries on the same project?
										</div>
										<div>
											Yes you can, but it has a little sense.
										</div>
									</li>-->
									<li>
										<div>
											What are the key concepts of Firera?
										</div>
										<div>
											Firera application consists of interdependent data streams. Unlike most FRP libraries, it has declarative syntax.
											It promotes pure functions usage, good composability and readability. Data are immutable.
											As a language, Firera is homoiconic.
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											Where should I use Firera - small, medium or big projects?
										</div>
										<div>
											Firera suits for both small and big projects. It can be used as a additional tool 
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											What are the cool features of Firera?
										</div>
										<div>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Declarative approach: do more with less code.
												</li>
												<li>
													Minimalistic, pure, fast HTML templates with Ozenfant.
												</li>
												<li>
													No shared mutable state
												</li>
												<li>
													Laconic and expressive. TodoMVC in 60 LOC of JS code(not including HTML template).
												</li>
												<li>
													Makes you create separate reusable components(in Firera's language "grids")
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											What are the weakpoints?
										</div>
										<div>
											<ul>
												<li>
													A sophisticated and complex syntax that might look strange and weird
												</li>
												<li>
													Not ready for enterprise
												</li>
												<li>
													Not a silver bullet.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											Comparing with other libraries...
										</div>
										<div>
											<ul>
												<li>
													React: less verbose, but almost as precise as React in controlling data flow.
													Real reactivity, less code. HTML rendering speed: comparable.
												</li>
												<li>
													Cycle.js: common philosophy, different syntax.
												</li>
												<li>
													Vue: a bit similar in templates, component structre. No data mutation, more FRP features.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											Is it easy to learn Firera?
										</div>
										<div>
											Well, in general - no. Moving to Firera from an imperative coding, e.g. with Angular, might be as hard as moving to Angular from jQuery.
											However, if you are familiar with FRP concept, it would be much easier to understand how Firera works. The most similar library is Cycle.js, though
											it has an imperative syntax.
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											Is Firera well tested? Ready for production?
										</div>
										<div>
											Currently, we have most of code covered with tests. However, the library hadn't been battle-tested in large projects yet.
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>
										<div>
											Firera might be interesting for people who...
										</div>
										<div>
											like functional programming, reactive programming...
											<br>enjoy declarative approach...
											<br>are familiar with Lisp, Clojure/ClojureScript... 
											<br>are tired of HTML+JS salad...
